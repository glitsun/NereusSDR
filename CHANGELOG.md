# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Hermes Lite 2 bandpass filter now switches on band/VFO change.** P1RadioConnection was emitting `m_alexHpfBits=0`/`m_alexLpfBits=0` permanently because the filter bits were never recomputed from frequency. P2 had the right code; lifted into shared `src/core/codec/AlexFilterMap` and called from P1's `setReceiverFrequency`/`setTxFrequency`. (Phase 3P-A)
- **Hermes Lite 2 step attenuator now actually attenuates.** P1's bank 11 C4 was using ramdor's 5-bit mask + 0x20 enable for every board; HL2 needs mi0bot's 6-bit mask + 0x40 enable + MOX TX/RX branch. Fixed via per-board codec subclasses (`P1CodecStandard` for Hermes/Orion, `P1CodecHl2` for HL2). RxApplet S-ATT slider range now widens to 0-63 dB on HL2 from `BoardCapabilities::attenuator.maxDb`. (Phase 3P-A)

### Added
- New **Diagnostics → Radio Status** dashboard consolidating Thetis's piecemeal readouts (Front Console, PA Settings, main meter) into a single 5-card layout: PA Status (temp/current/voltage with bar meters), Forward/Reflected/SWR, PTT Source (pill row for MOX/VOX/CAT/Mic/CW/Tune/2-Tone + 8-event history), Connection Quality summary, Settings Hygiene actions. (Phase 3P-H)
- New **Diagnostics → Connection Quality**, **Settings Validation**, **Export / Import**, **Logs** sibling sub-tabs. Connection Quality shows live EP6/EP2 byte rates + throttle + sequence-gap counter from `HermesLiteBandwidthMonitor`. Settings Validation lists `SettingsHygiene::issues()` with per-row Reset / Forget / Re-validate; auto-refreshes on `issuesChanged()`. Export / Import round-trips the full AppSettings XML via QFile + QFileDialog. (Phase 3P-H)
- `RadioStatus` aggregator (`src/core/RadioStatus.{h,cpp}`) — PA temperature/current/forward-reflected/SWR/active PttSource + 8-event PTT history. Variant `multi-source`; data shapes from Thetis `console.cs` status handlers `[@501e3f5]`. Owned by `RadioModel`. (Phase 3P-H)
- `SettingsHygiene` (`src/core/SettingsHygiene.{h,cpp}`) — NereusSDR-original. Validates AppSettings against `BoardCapabilities` on connect and emits per-MAC mismatch records (severity Critical / Warning / Info). Powers the dashboard Reset / Forget actions. (Phase 3P-H)
- `PttSource` enum (`src/core/PttSource.h`) — NereusSDR-original. Tracks the trigger that asserted MOX so the Radio Status dashboard highlights the active source. (Phase 3P-H)
- `RadioModel` wires PA telemetry from both protocols into `RadioStatus` and runs `SettingsHygiene::validate()` on every `Connected` transition. P1 extracts PA fwd/rev/exciter/userADC0/userADC1/supply raws from `parseEp6Frame`'s C0 telemetry cases 0x08/0x10/0x18; P2 reads the same six fields from `processHighPriorityStatus` at documented offsets. Thetis per-board scaling (`computeAlexFwdPower` / `computeRefPower` / `convertToVolts` / `convertToAmps` `[@501e3f5]`) applied verbatim. (Phase 3P-H)
- **Live LED wire-up across earlier-phase pages**: Alex-2 Filters HPF + LPF LED rows highlight the active filter for the current RX frequency (mirrors Thetis `setAlex2HPF` / `setAlex2LPF` first-match ranges); OC Outputs pin-state LED row reflects `OcMatrix::maskFor(band, isTx)` and flips on MOX; HL2 I/O register state table polls `IoBoardHl2::registerValue(idx)` at 40 ms + bandwidth meter lit from `HermesLiteBandwidthMonitor`. (Phase 3P-H)
- Tests: `tst_ptt_source` (10), `tst_radio_status` (18), `tst_settings_hygiene` (11), `tst_p1_status_telemetry` (4), `tst_p2_status_telemetry` (3), `tst_radio_model_status_wiring` (4), `tst_alex2_live_leds` (5), `tst_oc_outputs_live_pins` (5), `tst_hl2_live_polling` (4). (Phase 3P-H)
- New **Hardware → Calibration** Setup page (renamed from PA Calibration). Hosts 5 Thetis-1:1 group boxes: **Freq Cal** (frequency spinbox + Start button + accuracy helptext), **Level Cal** (reference freq/level + Rx1/Rx2 6m LNA offsets + Start/Reset), **HPSDR Freq Cal Diagnostic** (correction factor with 9 decimal places + Using external 10 MHz ref toggle + 10 MHz factor), **TX Display Cal** (dB offset), and the existing **PA Current (A) calculation** group (preserved exactly). Per-MAC persistence under `hardware/<mac>/cal/`. (Phase 3P-G)
- `CalibrationController` model holds frequency correction factor (default 1.0), separate 10 MHz factor, using10MHzRef toggle, level offset, Rx1/Rx2 6m LNA offsets, TX display offset, PA current sensitivity/offset. `effectiveFreqCorrectionFactor()` returns factor10M when using10MHzRef, else factor. Per-MAC persistence. Ports `setup.cs:5137-5144; 14036-14050; 22690-22706; 14325; 17243; 18315` + `console.cs:9764-9844; 21022-21086` `[@501e3f5]`. (Phase 3P-G)
- New **Hardware → HL2 I/O** Setup page replacing the Phase 3I empty placeholder. Diagnostic surface for HL2 owners: connection status (LED + I2C address + last-probe timestamp), N2ADR Filter enable, register state table (8 principal registers from the IoBoardHl2 33-register set), 12-step state machine visualizer (current step highlighted), I2C transaction log (monospace listing of recent enqueue/dequeue with timestamps), bandwidth monitor mini (EP6/EP2 byte-rate progress bars + LAN PHY throttle indicator). Auto-hides for non-HL2 boards. (Phase 3P-E)
- `IoBoardHl2` model — 33-register enum + I2C TLV circular queue (32 slots per `network.h:MAX_I2C_QUEUE`) + 12-step UpdateIOBoard state machine with human-readable step descriptors. Closes the long-deferred Phase 3I-T12 work. (Phase 3P-E)
- `HermesLiteBandwidthMonitor` — HL2 LAN PHY throttle detection layered on a faithful port of mi0bot's `bandwidth_monitor.{c,h}` two-pointer byte-rate compute. Tracks ep6 ingress + ep2 egress, flags throttle when ep6 stays silent for 3 consecutive ticks while ep2 has traffic. (Phase 3P-E)
- New **Hardware → OC Outputs** Setup page with HF + SWL sub-sub-tabs (SWL placeholder). Hosts the full OC Outputs surface modeled 1:1 on Thetis: master toggles (Penny Ext Control, N2ADR Filter, Allow hot switching, Reset OC defaults), per-band RX matrix (14 × 7), per-band TX matrix (14 × 7), TX Pin Action mapping (7 pins × 7 actions per `enums.cs:443-457` TXPinActions), USB BCD output config, External PA control, and live OC pin state LED stubs (Phase H wires them to ep6 status). (Phase 3P-D)
- New `OcMatrix` model (per-band × per-pin × per-mode bit storage + TX pin action mapping) backs the OC Outputs page. Per-MAC persistence under `hardware/<mac>/oc/{rx,tx}/<band>/pin<n>` and `.../actions/pin<n>/<action>`. Owned by `RadioModel`. (Phase 3P-D)
- **RxApplet preamp combo now populates per board** from `BoardCapabilities::preampItemsForBoard()` at construction time instead of hardcoded items. HL2 / OrionMKII / Saturn / Angelia-no-Alex show the 4-item anan100d set (Off / -10 / -20 / -30 dB); Alex-equipped boards (Hermes, Angelia, Orion) show the 7-item on_off+alex set; Atlas no-Alex shows the 2-item on_off set. On connect the combo was already repopulated (PR #34); this closes the pre-connect gap. Matches Thetis `SetComboPreampForHPSDR` (`console.cs:40755-40825 [@501e3f5]`). (Phase 3P-C)
- **Hermes Lite 2 preamp combo corrected to 4 items** (anan100d set: 0dB / -10dB / -20dB / -30dB). Previously returned a 1-item table ("0dB" only). HL2 is not in Thetis's `SetComboPreampForHPSDR` switch (postdates it), but its LNA supports the same 4-level control as the anan100d set per mi0bot HL2 LNA design `[@c26a8a4]`. (Phase 3P-C)
- New `tst_preamp_combo` (17 assertions) locks per-board combo contents 1:1 with Thetis and verifies the 7-mode `PreampMode` enum has correct integer indices (0=Off, 1=On, 2–6=Minus10–50). Also verifies `RxApplet.preampComboItemCountForTest()` reflects board caps at construction. (Phase 3P-C)
- Hardware → Antenna / ALEX page split into three sub-sub-tabs — Antenna Control (placeholder for Phase F), **Alex-1 Filters**, and **Alex-2 Filters** — matching Thetis's General → Alex IA. Alex-1 page exposes per-band HPF/LPF bypass + edge editors and the **Saturn BPF1 panel** (gated on ANAN-G2 / G2-1K). Alex-2 page exposes per-band HPF/LPF for the RX2 board with live-LED indicator stubs (Phase H wires them). Per-MAC persistence under `hardware/<mac>/alex/...` and `.../alex2/...`. (Phase 3P-B)
- ADC OVL badge in RxApplet now splits into OVL₀ + OVL₁ for dual-ADC boards (Orion-MKII family — boards with `BoardCapabilities::p2PreampPerAdc=true`). Single-ADC boards (HL2, Hermes, Angelia) keep a single badge. (Phase 3P-B)
- Per-ADC RX1 preamp toggle exposed in RxApplet for OrionMKII-family boards; routes to byte 1403 bit 1 in P2 CmdHighPriority via the new `P2RadioConnection::setRx1Preamp(bool)`. (Phase 3P-B)
- ANAN-G2 / G2-1K can now use user-configured Saturn BPF1 band edges instead of Alex defaults via the new Hardware → Antenna/ALEX → Alex-1 Filters page; codec layer (`P2CodecSaturn`) reads the configured edges from `CodecContext.p2SaturnBpfHpfBits`. (Phase 3P-B)
- New **Hardware → Antenna / ALEX → Antenna Control** sub-sub-tab — third sub-sub-tab alongside Phase B's Alex-1/Alex-2 Filters. Per-band antenna assignment grid (14 bands × TX/RX1/RX-only ports 1-3) with Block-TX safety toggles. Backed by AlexController model. (Phase 3P-F)
- `AlexController` — per-band TX/RX/RX-only antenna arrays + Block-TX safety + SetAntennasTo1 force mode. Per-MAC persistence. Replaces Phase 3I Alex stubs. Ports `HPSDR/Alex.cs:30-106`. (Phase 3P-F)
- `ApolloController` — Apollo PA + ATU + LPF accessory state model (present/filterEnabled/tunerEnabled). Per-MAC persistence. Capability-gated on `BoardCapabilities::hasApollo` (only HPSDR-kit per Thetis source). Ports `setup.cs:15566-15590`. (Phase 3P-F)
- `PennyLaneController` — Penny external control master enable (companion to Phase D's OcMatrix which holds the per-pin/per-band masks). Per-MAC persistence. Ports `Penny.cs` + `console.cs:14899`. (Phase 3P-F)
- `BoardCapabilities` extended with `hasApollo` / `hasAlex` / `hasPennyLane` per-board enable rules per Thetis `setup.cs:19834-20205` board-model if-ladder. Source-first correction caught: only HPSDR-kit enables Apollo (NOT all ANAN family — every ANAN board explicitly disables it in Thetis). (Phase 3P-F)

### Changed
- **P2RadioConnection** `setReceiverFrequency` / `setTxFrequency` Hz→phase-word conversion now multiplies by `CalibrationController::effectiveFreqCorrectionFactor()` (defaults to 1.0 → byte-identical to pre-cal). Per-MAC freq correction lets users compensate per-radio reference oscillator drift. Ports `NetworkIO.cs:227-254` `FreqCorrectionFactor` + `Freq2PhaseWord()` `[@501e3f5]`. (Phase 3P-G)
- PA Calibration setup tab renamed to **Calibration**; the existing PA Current (A) group preserved exactly. (Phase 3P-G)
- `P1CodecHl2` gains I2C intercept mode — when `IoBoardHl2`'s I2C queue has pending transactions, the next C&C frame's 5 bytes are overwritten with the I2C TLV payload (chip-address + control + register address + data) and the txn dequeued. Normal bank compose runs when queue is empty. Per mi0bot `networkproto1.c:898-943`. ep6 read path extended to parse I2C response frames (C0 bit 7 marker) back into IoBoardHl2 register state. (Phase 3P-E)
- `P1RadioConnection`'s ep6/ep2 packet sizes are now recorded into `HermesLiteBandwidthMonitor`; watchdog tick drives the periodic rate evaluation. The legacy sequence-gap fallback throttle heuristic remains as a safety net when the monitor isn't wired (test seam path). Closes long-open `TODO(3I-T12)` markers at `P1RadioConnection.cpp:892, 939, 1416-1462`. (Phase 3P-E)
- `RadioModel` now owns the per-connection `IoBoardHl2` and `HermesLiteBandwidthMonitor` instances and pushes them to `P1RadioConnection` at connect time, mirroring the OcMatrix ownership pattern from Phase 3P-D. (Phase 3P-E)
- `RxApplet` antenna buttons (Ant 1/2/3) now read from `AlexController::txAnt(currentBand)` / `rxAnt(currentBand)` and re-populate on band change. Click-to-select calls the controller setter, respecting Block-TX safety guards. Was: static placeholder buttons. (Phase 3P-F)
- `RadioModel` now owns `AlexController`, `ApolloController`, `PennyLaneController` instances and pushes MAC + load on connect, mirroring Phase D's OcMatrix and Phase E's IoBoardHl2 + HermesLiteBandwidthMonitor ownership patterns. (Phase 3P-F)
- `P1RadioConnection` and `P2RadioConnection` now source the OC byte at C&C compose time from `OcMatrix::maskFor(currentBand, mox)` (when the matrix is wired via `setOcMatrix()` — `RadioModel` pushes its `m_ocMatrix` to the connections at connect time) instead of the legacy `m_ocOutput` field. Falls through to legacy when the matrix is unset (test seams). Default state byte-identical: empty matrix → `maskFor()==0` matching legacy `m_ocOutput==0`. Regression-freeze gates (P1 + P2) still PASS byte-for-byte. (Phase 3P-D)
- `P1RadioConnection`'s C&C compose layer refactored into per-board codec subclasses (`P1CodecStandard`, `P1CodecHl2`, `P1CodecAnvelinaPro3`, `P1CodecRedPitaya`) behind a stable `IP1Codec` interface. Behavior byte-identical for every non-HL2 board (regression-frozen via `tst_p1_regression_freeze` against a pre-refactor JSON baseline). Set `NEREUS_USE_LEGACY_P1_CODEC=1` to revert to the pre-refactor compose path for one release cycle as a rollback hatch.
- `P2RadioConnection` now calls the shared `AlexFilterMap::computeHpf/Lpf` helpers instead of its own inline copies; byte output unchanged.
- `BoardCapabilities::Attenuator` extended with `mask`, `enableBit`, and `moxBranchesAtt` fields capturing per-board ATT byte encoding parameters.
- `P2RadioConnection`'s C&C compose layer refactored into per-board codec subclasses (`P2CodecOrionMkII` for the OrionMKII / 7000D / 8000D / AnvelinaPro3 family, `P2CodecSaturn` extending it for ANAN-G2 / G2-1K with the G8NJJ BPF1 override) behind the new `IP2Codec` interface. Behavior byte-identical to pre-refactor for all captured tuples (`tst_p2_regression_freeze` with 36 tuples). `NEREUS_USE_LEGACY_P2_CODEC=1` env var reverts to the pre-refactor compose path for one release cycle as a rollback hatch. (Phase 3P-B)
- `BoardCapabilities` extended with `p2SaturnBpf1Edges` (per-band start/end MHz, empty default) and `p2PreampPerAdc` (true for OrionMKII family). `AlexFilterMap` shared between P1 and P2 codecs (was Phase A; Phase B is the first P2 consumer). (Phase 3P-B)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-19

### Auto AGC-T (PR #53)

- `NoiseFloorTracker` — lerp-based noise-floor estimator feeding the
  Auto-threshold timer with MOX guard and `agcCalOffset`.
- AUTO button on the AGC-T slider row (VfoWidget + RxApplet) toggles
  auto-mode; periodic NF update keeps the threshold tracking.
- Right-click on the AGC-T slider opens Setup directly on the AGC/ALC
  page; Setup page controls wired to SliceModel.
- Thetis-source tooltips on all four AGC controls + attenuator
  fast-attack.

### Sample-rate wiring (PR #35)

- Per-MAC persistence of hardware sample rate + active-RX count under
  `hardware/<mac>/radioInfo/`.
- Full Thetis-parity rate lists: P1 = 48/96/192 kHz (plus 384 on
  RedPitaya); P2 = 48/96/192/384/768/1536 kHz. Default 192 kHz.
- RX2 sample-rate combo stub (disabled, for Phase 3F).
- Inline reconnect banner on RadioInfoTab when the selected rate
  differs from the active wire rate.

### Fixes

- **RxDspWorker thread-safety:** buffer-size fields now atomic; audio
  thread no longer races the main-thread control path.
- **RxDspWorker accumulator drain** scaled to per-rate `in_size` so
  DDC sample-rate changes don't starve the WDSP feed.
- **Setup dialog** no longer overrides `selectPage()` in `showEvent`,
  so right-click-to-page works as intended.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-04-16

RedPitaya / Hermes P1 protocol fixes driven by pcap analysis in issue #38,
plus Windows D3D11 container lifecycle fixes from issue #42.

### Fixed
- **P1 RedPitaya / Hermes family (#38):** restore DDC3 NCO command on the wire.
  The `kRxC0Address` lookup table was missing the `0x0A` address entry,
  which caused bank 6 (RX4 / DDC3 frequency) to be dropped and bank 9
  (RX7 / DDC6) to alias onto bank 10's `0x12` TX-drive slot. Verified
  byte-for-byte against Thetis `networkproto1.c` cases 6 and 9.
- **P1 EP2 send cadence (#38):** host→radio packets are now paced by a
  dedicated 2 ms `Qt::PreciseTimer` with a `QElapsedTimer`-driven catch-up
  loop, yielding ~200-400 pps (target: Thetis' 380.95 pps from its 48 kHz
  audio clock). Previously we ran ~40 pps, starving the radio's audio DAC
  and stretching the 17-bank C&C round-robin to ~213 ms per cycle.
- **Windows container float/dock rendering** — five interlocking issues in
  the meter container lifecycle on Windows D3D11 QRhi (#42):
  - HWND collision on reparent — `E_ACCESSDENIED` →
    `DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED` cascade from the old `MeterWidget`
    lingering under the parent HWND during `setParent()`. Old widget now
    detaches synchronously (`hide()` + `setParent(nullptr)`) before
    `deleteLater`; `ContainerManager` swaps the meter around each reparent
    so no `WA_NativeWindow` child is reparented.
  - First float landed at `(0,0)` behind the main window —
    `FloatingContainer::ensureVisiblePosition()` centers the form on the
    anchor's screen when saved geometry is missing, at origin, or
    off every connected screen.
  - Use-after-free in `MeterPoller` — raw `MeterWidget*` targets dangled
    when the reparent-swap destroyed them. Switched to
    `QVector<QPointer<MeterWidget>>` with null-guarded `poll()`.
  - Progressive stack compression across reparent cycles —
    `inferStackFromGeometry` merged touching row intervals into one
    cluster, collapsing N bar rows onto stack slot 0. Require strict
    overlap > 0.002 before merging.
  - Empty band below the meter stack on resizable containers — Thetis's
    fixed `kNormalRowHNorm = 0.05` assumes fixed-aspect containers; stack
    now shares `(1 − bandTop)` equally among rows. 24 px floor preserved
    for small widgets.

### Known issues
- **ANAN MM preset** still shows empty space below the needle panel when
  no bar rows are added. Thetis-faithful fix (per-container `AutoHeight`)
  is scoped in
  [`docs/architecture/meter-autoheight-plan.md`](docs/architecture/meter-autoheight-plan.md).
- Exit-time segfault (exit 139) reproducible on close; root cause still
  unknown, not implicated by the #42 changes.
- One `QRhiWidget: No QRhi` warning per meter install cycle; benign,
  under investigation.

## [0.1.7-rc1] - 2026-04-16

Radio model selector and P1 protocol completion for RedPitaya and non-standard
Hermes devices.

### Added
- **Radio model selector** — per-MAC model override in ConnectionPanel detail panel;
  users can select their actual radio model (e.g. "Red Pitaya") when the discovery
  board byte is ambiguous (e.g. reports "Hermes")
- **HardwareProfile engine** — port of Thetis clsHardwareSpecific.cs; maps 16
  HPSDRModel variants to correct ADC count, BPF, supply voltage, and board capabilities
- **P1 C&C full 17-bank round-robin** — port of Thetis networkproto1.c WriteMainLoop
  cases 0-17; was only sending 3 of 17 banks with zeros for dither/random/preamp/Alex filters
- **Radio Setup menu item** wired (was disabled NYI)
- Auto-reconnect loads persisted model override from AppSettings

### Fixed
- P1 bank 0 C3/C4 sent all zeros — dither, random, preamp, duplex now populated
- P1 reconnect log spam (30-80 duplicate "Reconnected" lines per cycle → 1 line)
- SaturnMKII board byte falls back to Saturn-family model instead of Hermes
- Null-guard on HardwareProfile caps pointer in P1/P2 connection setup

### Docs
- Phase 3I-RP design spec and implementation plan


## [0.1.6] - 2026-04-16

About dialog and built-in issue reporter.

### Added
- **About dialog** (Help → About NereusSDR) — version, build info, Qt/WDSP
  versions, heritage credits, license text, GPG fingerprint. Accessible from
  the menu bar and wired into the build.
- **AI-assisted issue reporter** — click the lightbulb (💡) in the menu bar
  corner to file a bug report or feature request directly from NereusSDR.
  Structured prompts guide you through the fields; submits to the GitHub
  issue tracker using the `bug_report.yml` and `feature_request.yml`
  templates.

### Tests

## [0.1.5] - 2026-04-16

Major feature release: RX DSP parity, step attenuator, Clarity adaptive display.

### Phase 3G-10: RX DSP Parity + AetherSDR Flag Port (Complete)

- **10 WDSP feature slices wired** end-to-end through SliceModel → RadioModel → RxChannel → WDSP: AGC advanced (threshold/hang/slope/attack/decay), EMNR (NR2), SNB, APF (SPCW module), squelch (SSB/AM/FM 3-variant), mute/audio pan/binaural, NB2 advanced params, RIT/XIT client offset, frequency lock, mode containers (FM OPT/DIG/RTTY)
- **Per-slice-per-band persistence** via AppSettings (`Slice<N>/Band<key>/*` namespace) with legacy key migration and band-change save/restore cycle
- **VfoWidget rewrite** — 4-tab layout (Audio/DSP/Mode/X-RIT), 4×2 DSP toggle grid, AGC 5-button row, S-meter level bar with dBm readout and cyan→green gradient, mode containers (FM/DIG/RTTY), tooltip coverage test
- **AGC-T ↔ RF Gain bidirectional sync** — both control the same WDSP max_gain; `GetRXAAGCTop`/`GetRXAAGCThresh` readback prevents audio-breaking gain runaway
- **S-meter wired** to VfoWidget via MeterPoller `smeterUpdated` signal
- **Thetis-first tooltip sweep** — 18 controls updated with verbatim Thetis text and source-line citations
- 17 new test files, widget library (VfoLevelBar, ScrollableLabel, GuardedComboBox, TriBtn, ResetSlider, CenterMarkSlider)

### Phase 3G-13: Step Attenuator & ADC Overload (PR #34)

- **StepAttenuatorController** with Classic + Adaptive auto-attenuation modes, hysteresis, and per-MAC persistence
- **P1/P2 ADC overflow detection** — `adcOverflow` signal from frame parsers, OVL status badge in RxApplet
- **Setup → General → Options** page for step ATT configuration
- **RxApplet ATT/S-ATT row** with per-model preamp items from Thetis `SetComboPreampForHPSDR`
- 9 controller tests

### Phase 3G-9: Display Refactor

- **Clarity Blue waterfall palette** — full-spectrum rainbow with deep-black noise floor
- **ClarityController** with cadence, EWMA, deadband + NoiseFloorEstimator percentile estimator
- **Reset to Smooth Defaults** button on Setup → Display → Spectrum Defaults
- **Re-tune button + Clarity status badge** in spectrum overlay panel
- **Per-band Clarity memory** in BandGridSettings
- **Zoom persistence** — visible bandwidth saved/restored across restarts
- Thetis-cited tooltips on 47 Spectrum/Waterfall/Grid setup controls
- SliderRow/SliderRowD TDD factory helpers for setup pages

### Phase 3G-11: P1 Field Fixes

- **P1 VFO frequency encoding** — encode as raw Hz, not NCO phase word

### Fixes

- Bidirectional AGC-T ↔ RF Gain sync (prevents audio runaway)
- AGC-T slider direction inverted to match Thetis (right = more gain)
- RF Gain slider removed (redundant with AGC-T)
- S-meter continuous gradient cyan→green at S9 boundary
- S-meter dBm readout with clipping fix
- NYI overlays removed on live-wired FM/DIG/RTTY containers
- Mode tab layout matches AetherSDR (combo fills row)
- DSP grid equal-column stretch eliminates gap
- AGC-T right-click context menu → Setup dialog
- Windows linker ODR violation resolved (TriBtn consolidation)
- Waterfall AGC margin widened 3→12 dB

## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-14

Bug-fix release. Improves Hermes (Protocol 1) startup reliability and
fixes two Windows-only crashes seen on cold launch / shutdown. Also
relaxes an over-aggressive board firmware-version gate that rejected
some legitimate radios.

### Fixes
- **P1 Hermes DDC priming** — prime the DDC before sending `metis-start`
  on Hermes-class boards, declare `nddc=2`, and alternate the TX/RX1
  command banks. Resolves silent RX after connect on Hermes.
- **Windows startup/shutdown crashes** — fix two latent crashes that
  surfaced on Windows clean installs (cold-start init order and
  shutdown teardown ordering).
- **Connect: drop unattested firmware floors** — remove per-board
  firmware-version minimums that were never verified against
  real-world firmware ranges and were blocking valid radios.


## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-13

Hotfix for the v0.1.2 Windows artifacts. Linux and macOS builds are
functionally identical to v0.1.2 — only the Windows installer and
portable ZIP have changed.

### Fixes
- **Windows NSIS installer** — fixed missing Qt6 DLL packaging that
  caused startup crash on clean Windows installs.
- **Windows portable ZIP** — same DLL fix as installer.


## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-13

First full cross-platform alpha release with all 6 build artifacts.

### Added
- Linux AppImage (x86_64 + aarch64)
- macOS Apple Silicon DMG
- Windows portable ZIP + NSIS installer
- Consolidated `release.yml` CI pipeline
- `/release` skill for Claude Code

### Fixes
- Linux: added `qtshadertools` build dependency
- Linux aarch64: disabled GPU spectrum (no Vulkan in CI container)
- release.yml: fixed artifact upload paths


## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-12

Internal milestone — Phase 3I Radio Connector complete.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-10

Initial alpha — RX-only, Protocol 2 (ANAN-G2), spectrum + waterfall,
container meter system, 12 applets, 47-page setup dialog.
